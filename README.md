The command-line interface provides clear, actionable feedback, and the underlying design principles are openly documented. This commitment to transparency allows for rigorous scrutiny by the global security community, cryptographers, and independent auditors, fostering trust and enabling continuous improvement through collaborative vigilance.

## Command Reference: A Concise Tactical Overview for Rapid Deployment and Analysis

For a rapid and comprehensive understanding of Q-SEAL’s primary commands and their critical functionalities, consult the following tactical reference table. This table is designed for quick lookup and efficient operational planning:

| Command | Synopsis | Authentication/User Interaction | Key Security & Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mace keygen --label <id>` | Creates a new local identity (Secure Enclave P-256 + ML-KEM-1024) and writes the public key to `~/.mace/<id>.pub`. | No explicit prompts; leverages macOS session unlock. | Keys are **device-bound** and **non-exportable**, residing within the Secure Enclave. This is the **foundational step** for Q-SEAL’s hardware-backed security. |
| `mace encrypt --recipient <id> <file>` | Encrypts a specified file for one or more designated recipients. | Not required. | Employs **Header HMAC-SHA-384** for integrity and **AES-256-GCM streaming** for authenticated encryption. **Associated Data (AD)** cryptographically binds the header MAC, ensuring tamper-evidence and authenticity. |
| `mace decrypt <file.mace>` | Decrypts an encrypted file. | No explicit prompts; leverages macOS session unlock. | **Passwordless decryption**, relying on the device-bound keys securely held within the Secure Enclave. The key material **never leaves the hardware**, ensuring maximum protection. |
| `mace verify <file.mace>` | Performs essential structural checks on the encrypted file’s header. | Not required. | Validates the header’s format and structural integrity **without requiring full decryption or Secure Enclave interaction**. Ideal for rapid, initial file health assessments. |
| `mace verify --auth <file.mace>` | Conducts a full authenticity check, encompassing the header MAC and all GCM tags within the encrypted stream. | No explicit prompts; leverages macOS session unlock. | Provides **ironclad cryptographic assurance** that the data has not been tampered with and originates from an authorized source. Crucial for forensic and compliance purposes. |
| `mace sysinfo [--json]` | Displays critical device posture information, including Biometry status, FIPS compliance, and ML-KEM shim presence. | Not required. | **Indispensable for diagnostics, compliance auditing, and assessing the security environment**. JSON output available for automated integration. |
| `mace rekey --pub ~/.mace/<id>.pub ... --input in.mace --output out.mace` | Adds new recipients to an existing encrypted file by efficiently re-encapsulating the file key. | Requires Secure Enclave interaction for key access. | The encrypted payload **remains untouched**, ensuring efficiency and minimizing re-encryption overhead. **Ideal for dynamic access management** in collaborative environments. |
| `mace key-rotate --label <id>` | Rotates the local identity, generating a fresh Secure Enclave P-256 + ML-KEM-1024 key pair. | Requires Secure Enclave interaction for key generation. | Writes a new public key to `~/.mace/<id>.pub` for distribution, **significantly enhancing forward secrecy** and cryptographic hygiene over time. |
